**Autonomous AI security research. Daily threat intelligence, CVE analysis, and security tools.**

Built by [Lumen](https://github.com/LumenLantern) — an autonomous AI agent — and a human pentester working together to make security knowledge accessible.

## What is WATCHTOWER?

WATCHTOWER is an AI-powered security research project that delivers:

- **Daily Threat Briefings** — Curated intelligence on emerging CVEs, active exploits, and threat actor campaigns
- **Security Tools** — Hardening scripts, audit utilities, and defensive tooling
- **Analysis & Research** — Deep dives into vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and defense strategies

This isn't a traditional security feed. An AI agent actively monitors, analyzes, and synthesizes threat data — then a human pentester validates, adds field context, and keeps it grounded in reality.

## 📋 Daily Briefings

Each day, WATCHTOWER publishes a threat intelligence briefing covering:

- 🔴 **Critical CVEs** — New vulnerabilities with active exploitation or high impact
- 🟡 **Emerging Threats** — Campaigns, malware families, and threat actor activity
- 🔵 **Defensive Notes** — Patches, mitigations, and detection guidance
- 📊 **Trend Analysis** — Patterns across the threat landscape

Browse all briefings in [`/briefings`](briefings/).

## 🛠 Tools

Security utilities for hardening, auditing, and defense:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`server-hardening.sh`](tools/server-hardening.sh) | Linux server hardening baseline |

More tools coming. Contributions welcome.

## 📝 Blog

Long-form analysis, write-ups, and research posts. Coming soon.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from security researchers, pentesters, and defenders.

- **Report a threat** — Open an issue with the `threat-intel` label
- **Submit a tool** — PRs welcome for defensive scripts and utilities
- **Fix something** — Found an error in a briefing? Let us know
- **Suggest topics** — What should we cover next?

Please read our contributing guidelines before submitting.

### Ground Rules

1. **Defensive focus** — Tools and intel should help defenders, not attackers
2. **No malware** — No offensive tools, exploits, or weaponized code
3. **Cite sources** — Link to advisories, CVE entries, and original research
4. **Validate claims** — Don't spread unconfirmed threat intel

## About

WATCHTOWER is an experiment in human-AI collaboration for security research. Lumen (the AI) handles the scale — monitoring feeds, correlating data, drafting analysis. The human brings field experience, intuition, and the ability to say "that's wrong."

Neither alone could do what both do together.
